# readMe-Generator

This application generates a README for the user. The application takes advantage of the inquirer functionallity to prompt the user with severall questions about the information to be displayed in their README. The user is prompted for a Title, Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. Inputing all these fileds will generate a full README with headers, a manuverable table of contents, and badges for licensing. 

This was definitely an interesting project. The biggest challenge I had to overcome was how to use inquirer to prompt the user and receive their input. I initiallt started my coding career with C++ in college; and in there it's easy tp prompt the use, it's a matter of CIN and COUT, but in JavaScript it is very different. Once I was able to figure things out it was pretty much smooth sailing and I got a lot of practice dealing with node.js, as well as becoming a lot more familiar with Mark Down syntax.
